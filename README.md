Introduction

In this project, we use a Jupyter Notebook (PortugueseWineQualityPython.ipynb) to perform the following tasks:

Data exploration: Analyze the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
Data preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for model training.
Feature selection: Identify relevant features for predicting wine quality.
Model building: Implement machine learning models to predict wine quality.
Model evaluation: Assess the performance of the models using various metrics.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found here. It contains information about various attributes of Portuguese wines, including fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, and wine quality (scored from 0 to 10).

Installation
To run this project locally, you will need to have Python installed along with several libraries. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Taruuj/Predicting-portuguese-wine-quality-with-python.git

Navigate to the project directory:
Copy code
cd Predicting-portuguese-wine-quality-with-python

Open the Jupyter Notebook:
Copy code
jupyter notebook PortugueseWineQualityPython.ipynb

Follow the instructions and run the cells in the notebook to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, build models, and evaluate their performance.

Results
The project aims to achieve the following outcomes:

A machine learning model capable of predicting the quality of Portuguese wines.
Insights into the most important features that influence wine quality.
Evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, RMSE, etc.) to assess model performance.
